## Introduction ##
  1. What is a brief definition of the topic?

    *Using OCR to heighten the effectiveness of practical tasks that involve characters created
    through penmanship.  
    Essentially, I am creating a piece of software that allows an individual to manage an uploaded handwritten grocery list.
    This should allow them to mark out selected items, categorize items, etc.*

  2. Why should I read your paper about this topic?

    *This project caters to the stay-at-home moms who would like a little bit more efficiency in there day to day..............*

## Background and Topic Prerequisites ##
  1. What is the history and background of your topic? I.e. why is it even a thing?

    *Optical Character Recognition is a technology used to identify text within images
    like documents and photos. Its function is to convert any image containing written
    text (typed, handwritten or printed) into machine-readable text data.

    The first OCR tools in modern history were developed in the early-to-mid 1900â€™s,
    but the ideas were brewing for years before that.The Nipkow Disk was an image
    scanning device all the way back in 1885. Later devices started by interpreting
    Morse Code to read text aloud. The first scanners capable of reading text required
    that the text be in a special font that was easy for the scanning software to
    recognize. In 1974, Kurzweil Computer Products developed the first omni-font software.

    Much of the first work in this space was in English, using the Latin alphabet.
    In 1992, the Cyrillic alphabet got some love and Russian text could be digitized.
    By the year 2000 we had online OCR services that could translate scanned text
    into other languages, and this is when OCR really picked up some steam.

    By moving the processing from the scanner (or the computer it was attached to)
    up into the cloud allowed OCR to shift from being a product to becoming a service.*
