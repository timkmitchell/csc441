## Presentation Topics

1. Practical Applications of Optical Character Recognition

     *Tesseract, Tensorflow, Opencv, Pytesseract, Scikit Learn, Pillow

        - Using machine learning and ocr to identify handwritten characters.

        - Taking a look at the reasons why we would want to be able to identify handwritten characters. An example would recognizing items on a shopping list and letting user check off when they have purchased that item.

2. Predicting Students Performance in Final Examination

     *Using Linear Regression and Multilayer Perceptron.

        - Linear Regression - finding a line that bests represents data points available on a plot. This is used to predict outputs that aren't present in the given data set, with the belief that those outputs would fall on the line. Approach to modeling that shows the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.

        - Multilayer Perceptron - is a deep, artificial neural network. ... They are composed of an input layer to receive the signal, an output layer that makes a decision or prediction about the input, and in between those two, an arbitrary number of hidden layers that are the true computational engine of the MLP.

3. Study of Machine Learning Algorithms for Special Disease Prediction

     *Using Principal of Component Analysis

        - Principle Component Analysis - is a dimension-reduction tool that can be used to reduce a large set of variables to a small set that still contains most of the information in the large set.
